// Assuming the original code was something like this (since only a comment is provided):

// ...moved to app/dashboard/sports/nba/page.tsx...

//  Let's assume some original imports:
// import React from 'react';
// import something from './something';


// Updated code with corrected import paths:
import React from 'react';
import something from '@/app/dashboard/sports/nba/something'; // Example corrected path


// ... rest of the code ...
