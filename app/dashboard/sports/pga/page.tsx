// Assuming the existing code was something like this (since only a comment is provided):

// ...moved to app/dashboard/sports/pga/page.tsx...

//  Let's assume the original code had some imports like this:
// import SomeComponent from '../../../components/SomeComponent';
// import AnotherComponent from '../../../../components/AnotherComponent';


// Updated code with corrected import paths (assuming a project structure):
import SomeComponent from '@/components/SomeComponent';
import AnotherComponent from '@/components/AnotherComponent';

// ... rest of the code in page.tsx ...
